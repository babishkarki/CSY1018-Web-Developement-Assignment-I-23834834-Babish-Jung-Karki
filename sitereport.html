                    The website is created as a personal showcase for a web development project. The website is hosted
                    on GitHub Pages and features a straightforward layout with five sections—Home, Portfolio,
                    Experience, Report and
                    Contact—with a navigation menu. HTML and CSS are used in the development of the website.

                <p class="text">
                    The website features a simple design with a white background and a black font color. The website is
                    simple to read because the font size is uniform throughout. The website's top bar contains a
                    navigation menu, and selecting any of the items takes the user to the appropriate section. Because
                    of its responsive design, which adjusts to various screen sizes, it is simple to see the website on
                    many devices.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The website's code quality is good, and it follows the best practices for web development. The
                    HTML and CSS are separated into separate files and the code is nicely organized, making it simple to
                    understand and update. The CSS code is used to enable smooth scrolling when a user clicks on
                    a menu item, and it is well-commented, making it easy to understand.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The website is overall well-designed, navigable, and the content is well-structured and simple to
                    comprehend. The website's code is of good quality and follows the best practice for web
                    development.

                <p class="text">
                    The experience of learning web development has been wonderful. The module leader, Mr. Chirag Thapa,
                    had always been supportive to me. About our topic, we have a lot of talks. CSS coding was
                    challenging at first, but with the assistance of the module leader, I was able to get through a
                    number of challenges and am now better than ever able to design my HTML using CSS. I am certain that
                    with the ongoing assistance of my module leader, I will soon be able to create excellent websites.

                    My website has a simple design and a simple theme that I created myself. To create a nice website, I
                    worked very hard and employed straightforward materials. Before deciding on the current layout, I
                    sketched simple sketches of a number of different website designs on a piece of blank paper. This
                    page has a straightforward layout with three sections: a header with a navigation bar to access
                    other websites, a body with areas for adding texts, images, and paragraphs, and a footer with my
                    name and the date the page was created. </p>
